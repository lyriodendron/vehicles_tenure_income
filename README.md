Tabulations of ACS PUMS data for vehicle ownership broken down by housing tenure and household income

These tabulations show car ownership of renter and homeowner households in Philadelphia, broken out by income level. Renter and homeowner households are broken out into separate tables. For each of those tables, you can also find the data broken out by geographical areas, called PUMAs (see below for details).
Each of the tables shows the estimated count of households at each income level that own 0 vehicles, 1 vehicle, 2 vehicles, and so forth up to 6+ vehicles. Then it shows the proportion of households at each income level that owns 0 vehicles, 1 vehicle, &c.

Data sources:
The raw data come from the Census Bureau, specifically ACS public use microdata (PUMS), 5-year, vintage 2019
For descriptions and maps of PUMAs, see:

Income levels are calculated according to percentages of the Philadelphia Metro Area Median Income. For example, AMI_20 means 'household income at or below 20% of Philadelphia Metro AMI' and AMI_80plus means 'household income greater than 80% of Philadelphia Metro AMI'.
The AMI value is taken from PFHA's income limits table, which uses the values published by HUD (see column 'Median Inc'):
